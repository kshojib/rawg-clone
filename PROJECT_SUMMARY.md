   NEXT_PUBLIC_RAWG_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

   ```
5. **Open** http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy)

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Color Scheme (Dark Theme)

- Grid: 1 column (mobile) → 2 columns (tablet) → 3 columns (desktop)

### Typography

- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headings: Bold, 2xl to 5xl
- Body: Regular, sm to base

## 📊 API Integration

### Endpoints Used

1. `GET /games` - List games with filters
2. `GET /games/{slug}` - Game details
3. `GET /genres` - List all genres
4. `GET /platforms` - List all platforms

### Caching Strategy

- Games: 1 hour (3600s)
- Genres/Platforms: 24 hours (86400s)
- Next.js automatically caches at build time

### Rate Limits

- Free tier: 20,000 requests/month
- That's about 660 requests/day
- Caching helps stay within limits
